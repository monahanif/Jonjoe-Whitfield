          <div class="col"><h2>About me</h2>I was brought up in Lyndurst,in a loving family. I am the oldest of four sibling. 
                    Whilst studying to become a paremedic, I was helping out in the kitchen in the local pubs, eventually becaming a chef.
                    Unfortunately, in my last year I was involved in a car accident, and tore every muscles of my body. 
                    I was out of action for an year, and then changed my whole career to pragamming and haven looked back</div>

            <div class="col"><h2>Likes</h2>I firstly love my family and New Forest. 
                    I enjoy playing games, watching nerdy shows like star trek.I am a huge Star War fan too.  
                    I take quite alot of pride that I have converted my girlfriend into a nerd, otherwise we would have nothing in common. 
                    I enjoy cooking for people, and do occasionally boast to my girlfriend about my cooking skills, which she ignores as she does enjoy my food. Oops here I go again, boasting. </div>
                
            <div class="col"><h2>Dislikes</h2>Errr I dislike, what do I dislike? I do not like heat, as I am like a polar bear. I'm big, and grizzly and occasionaly sweaty (nothing that deododant can't fixed).
                I also do not like being not in control, everything has to be my way or the highway. Yeah, Im pretty spoiled that way, but hey, I wouldn't have got here if I didn't have that attitude. 
                I always get what I want.</div>

            <div class="col"><h2>Future plans</h2>Well my plans is to whisk my girlfriend away to an amazing holiday, possibly somewhere romantic like Venice. Or maybe Morocca, as shes mentioned that she would like to go there. 
                Maybe I should buy her flowers again, she really liked it last time. But maybe lilies this time, as those are her favourite.</div>
